Files and best practices for a JavaScript project.

## jsconfig

Similar to `tsconfig.json` it is a good practice to have a `jsconfig.json` file:

> The presence of jsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a JavaScript Project. The jsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the options for the features provided by the JavaScript language service.
